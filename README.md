Files for the third, fourth, and fifth labs for CS 145 W25 - Group members: Lucy, Sunny, Logan
The requirements for Lab 3 are met by extending the attributes of the "Book" class into the "Novel" and "Textbook" subclasses, which are then used in the main method.
The requirements for Lab 4 are met by the IllegalArgumentFound exception that is thrown when the user attempts to enter a value for the gradeLevel variable that is less than 1 or more than 12.
The requirements for Lab 5 are met by making the "Book" class an abstract class and having the main method only create objects out of the "Novel" and "Textbook" subclasses.
